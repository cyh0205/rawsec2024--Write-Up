# Cali Cartel CTF Writeup

## Challenge Information
- **Category**: OSINT  
- **Points**: 50

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to perform OSINT (Open Souce Intelligence) to uncover a member of Cali Cartel who has betrayed Cali.

## Solution
To complete this challenge, I have searched for Cali Cartel in my browser and stumbled upon a few subreddits talking about it. I was getting lucky while solving this challenge by just **"Ctrl + F"** to find the keyword **"RWSC"** in a subreddit called narcos. I manage to get the first blood of the question too.
